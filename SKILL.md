# Heptabase CLI

A CLI that wraps the Heptabase MCP server. Search, read, and write to your Heptabase knowledge base from the terminal.

## Prerequisites

- The `heptabase` binary must be on your PATH (see https://github.com/madeyexz/heptabase-cli)
- First run opens a browser for OAuth login; tokens cache in `~/.mcp-auth/`

## Tools

### 1. Save as a card (`save-to-note-card`)

Creates a new note card in your Heptabase Inbox (like the Web Clipper).

```bash
heptabase save-to-note-card --content "# Title

Body text in markdown"
```

- First h1 line becomes the card title
- Great for: turning AI answers into permanent notes, saving outlines/plans/summaries, capturing ideas to organize later on a whiteboard

### 2. Append to journal (`append-to-journal`)

Adds content as new blocks to today's journal. Does NOT overwrite existing content. Auto-creates today's journal if it doesn't exist.

```bash
heptabase append-to-journal --content "Some journal entry"
```

- Ideal for: daily reflections, quick logs ("summarize what I worked on today"), capturing ideas that belong in your daily record

### 3. Semantic search (`semantic-search-objects`)

Finds objects in your knowledge base using full-text + semantic (meaning-based) search.

```bash
# 1-3 natural language queries, comma-separated
# result-object-types: card,pdfCard,mediaCard,highlightElement,journal (or empty for all)
heptabase semantic-search-objects --queries "machine learning,neural networks" --result-object-types "card,pdfCard"
```

- Use when: asking about topics you've taken notes on, rediscovering related content, needing the AI to reason using your existing knowledge
- Returns previews with titles and partial content
- Follow up with `get-object` for full content, or `search-whiteboards` to explore related whiteboards

### 4. Find whiteboards (`search-whiteboards`)

Searches whiteboards by name and keywords.

```bash
# 1-5 keywords, comma-separated, OR logic
heptabase search-whiteboards --keywords "project management,productivity"
```

- Helps understand how your content is organized visually
- Use when: looking for a specific project whiteboard, understanding workspace structure
- Follow up with `get-whiteboard-with-objects` to see what's on them

### 5. Explore a whiteboard (`get-whiteboard-with-objects`)

Returns the full structure of a whiteboard: cards, sections, text elements, mindmaps, images, and connections between them.

```bash
heptabase get-whiteboard-with-objects --whiteboard-id <id>
```

- Shows how ideas are grouped and connected
- Use when: you want help understanding or reorganizing a board, need summaries based on how you've arranged things visually
- Follow up with `get-object` for deeper reads on specific cards

### 6. Read full object content (`get-object`)

Retrieves complete content of a single object — no chunk limits.

```bash
# Types: card, journal, videoCard, audioCard, imageCard, highlightElement,
#        textElement, videoElement, imageElement, chat, chatMessage,
#        chatMessagesElement, section
heptabase get-object --object-id <id> --object-type card
```

- Returns full content including transcripts for video/audio cards
- Check the `hasMore` flag to know if you have all the content
- Do NOT use on pdfCard — too large. Use `search-pdf-content` + `get-pdf-pages` instead
- Use when: you need detailed summaries, translations, or explanations of a specific note

### 7. Review journals by date range (`get-journal-range`)

Retrieves all journal entries between two dates (inclusive).

```bash
heptabase get-journal-range --start-date 2026-01-01 --end-date 2026-03-01
```

- Max 92 days (~3 months) per call. For longer periods, make multiple calls
- Use when: reviewing past work, preparing retrospectives, summarizing what you wrote over a period

### 8. Search within a PDF (`search-pdf-content`)

Keyword-based search inside a specific PDF using BM25 matching (fuzzy, OR logic).

```bash
# 1-5 keywords, comma-separated. Use synonyms for broader coverage
heptabase search-pdf-content --pdf-card-id <id> --keywords "gradient descent,optimization,learning rate"
```

- Returns up to 80 ranked chunks with surrounding context
- You must find the PDF card ID first using `semantic-search-objects`
- Follow up with `get-pdf-pages` to read full pages around the matches

### 9. Read PDF pages (`get-pdf-pages`)

Retrieves complete content from a specific page range.

```bash
# Pages start at 1, both inclusive
heptabase get-pdf-pages --pdf-card-id <id> --start-page-number 1 --end-page-number 10
```

- Use after `search-pdf-content` to pull full pages for summarization or translation
- For >100 pages, ask the user to confirm first

## Common Workflows

### Discover → Read → Save

1. `semantic-search-objects` — find relevant notes on a topic
2. `get-object` — read the full content
3. Reason, summarize, or answer based on the content
4. `save-to-note-card` or `append-to-journal` — save the output back

### Explore a whiteboard

1. `search-whiteboards` — find the whiteboard by topic
2. `get-whiteboard-with-objects` — see all objects and connections
3. `get-object` — deep dive into specific cards on the board

### Review past journals

1. `get-journal-range` — fetch entries for a period (split into 92-day chunks if needed)
2. Summarize or analyze patterns across entries
3. `append-to-journal` — add the summary to today's journal

### Work with a large PDF

1. `semantic-search-objects --result-object-types pdfCard` — find the PDF
2. `search-pdf-content` — locate relevant sections by keywords
3. `get-pdf-pages` — pull full pages for detailed reading
4. `save-to-note-card` — save key takeaways as a new note

## Output Formats

All commands accept `--output <format>`:
- `text` (default) — human-readable
- `json` — structured JSON, good for piping into `jq`
- `markdown` — markdown formatted
- `raw` — raw MCP response

## Global Flags

- `--timeout <ms>` — call timeout (default: 30000)
- `--raw <json>` — bypass flag parsing, pass raw JSON arguments directly
